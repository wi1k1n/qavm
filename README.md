# QAVM

Quality Assurance Version Manager manages software on your machine. The main focus is to list and conveniently categorize different versions of the same software, hence it's a perfect tool for the Quality Assurance specialists.

This is a rethought version of the [C4D Version Manager](https://github.com/wi1k1n/cinema4d_version_manager), generalized to be applicable to any software and optimized and restructured code-wise.

## TODOs

* PluginUID and SoftwareID are used all over the place separately or concatenated, and this creates kind of a mess. Should be a centralized place of hanlding such IDs
